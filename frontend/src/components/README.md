# Components

This directory contains all reusable React components, organized by category.

## Structure

- `ui/` - Primitive UI components (buttons, inputs, cards, modals, etc.)
- `layout/` - Layout components (header, footer, sidebar, navigation)
- `forms/` - Form-related components (form fields, validation displays)
- `common/` - Shared, feature-agnostic components used across the app

## Guidelines

1. Components should be small, focused, and reusable
2. Each component should have its own folder with `index.ts` for exports
3. Keep styling co-located with components
4. Use TypeScript interfaces for all props
